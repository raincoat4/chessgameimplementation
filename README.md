# Chess Group Project
Chess Group Project for CMPT 276 (Introduction to Software Engineering), Summer 2023.  
While the submitted final result is private and only accessible by the group members and the teacher, this repository presents the work I was responsble of for my group.  
My primary responsibility was to manage the setup of the board, as well as presentation of the pieces. Additionally, while movement restrictions specific to each piece 
were later organized and implemented by the other members of my group, I had the sole responsibility for the intial prototype, which implemented general movement of the 
pieces, which was essentially their ability to "move" at all.  

The project in this respository is the prototype I mentioned above.
